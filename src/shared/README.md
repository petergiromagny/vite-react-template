# Shared Directory

This directory contains reusable components, utilities, and hooks that are shared across multiple features of the application. The shared module serves as a common foundation for the entire application.

## Directory Structure

```

  │   ├── atoms/             # Smallest UI building blocks
  │   ├── molecules/         # Combinations of atoms
  │   └── organisms/         # Complex UI components
  ├── hooks/               # Common custom hooks
  ├── utils/               # Utility functions and helpers
  ├── types/               # Common TypeScript types

   - Follow accessibility best practices
   - Maintain theme consistency

4. **Type Safety**:

   - Write comprehensive TypeScript types
   - Export types for external use
   - Use generics where appropriate
